## Game Description




Here comes your first opponent, standing in front of you. He is wearing a blue hat, looks kind and cooperative. From his eyes, you can see panic and fear, which reveals the same kind of desire for survival as yours. You need to play with him for five rounds. Should you cooperate so that both of you can safely get 10 coins? But will he do the same? Or should you cheat him to gain some more? 

Regardless of your choices and outcomes, there are four more opponents waiting for you. You need to play five rounds with each of them. You will get a description of their appearance, and perhaps you can obtain some information and make the right choice. 

Can you get enough coins and survive the trip?
